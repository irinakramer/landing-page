## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. It required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file `js/app.js`.

## Specifications

Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
