## Description
The goal of this project was to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. 

**Specifications:**
* Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
* It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
* When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

## Prerequisite
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. It required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily building JavaScript file `js/app.js` from scratch.

## Installation

To install this project, one can clone this repository or download the .zip file.

## Runtime Environment

This project can be run locally in a browser, no need to have a running server.
* Open web browser
* File > Open File... > Locate index.html where this project was downloaded.
* View and interact with the Landing page.
